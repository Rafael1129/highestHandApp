# highestHandApp

Instructions:


Assumptions while writing code:
#1 Assumed at beggining of project that the Node app should have a UI, which caused some time to be wasted implementing some UI work with React. By the intructions, printing to console was sufficient, so I strated the app from scratch without implemnting a web framework.
#2 Assumed that Node js would not have too much of a learning curve, from a Ruby perspective. The intructions stated that other language could be used, which I should have done instead of writing in a language I am not very familiar with.
#3 Assumed that global variables could easily be accessed when importing another class(or module in this case) or more specifically I misunderstood the best practices to do so in Node js.
#4 Greatly understimated or assumed that figuring out the hands in Poker would be more or less a matter of adding the hand. More thought should have being put in designing a proper solution before writing the code for the portion that identifies the highest hand. Starting the code before having a full picture regarding the solution caused a lot of time wasted on "solutions" that did not work.
#5 Assumed that tests would be somewhat straighforward, so writing the tests were left as last step, which goes agains't best practices of writing most of the tests before implementing a solution.
